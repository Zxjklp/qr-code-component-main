## My process

1. Setting Up the Project: I created a new project directory and set up the basic file structure, including index.html, index.css, and the necessary assets.

2. HTML Structure: I wrote the HTML structure. I included the main elements such as the QR code image, heading, and paragraph.

3. Styling with CSS: I created a CSS file and defined custom properties (CSS variables) for colors. I applied styles to the HTML elements to match the design, including layout, typography, and spacing.

4. Responsive Design: I ensured that the design was responsive and looked good on different screen sizes by using flexible units like rem and max-width.

5. Testing: I tested the project in different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. I made adjustments as needed to fix any issues.
